# NotePrompt

Since we spend most of our time on our terminals, it would be handy to be able to maintain tasks, reminders, alarms and timers at the same place.

## Current Features
* Alarms - Alarms can be added. The background process will print an alert at the time of an alarm
* Tasks - Tasks can be added and removed. All the current tasks can also be viewed through the cli

## TODO
* Better display of current tasks
* Timed tasks a.k.a reminders
* Add timer
* Incorporate the #tasks, timer info, etc as parts of prompt (right side)
